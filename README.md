# Data Analytics 

This repository contains a collection of diverse data analytics projects I worked on, showcasing my skills in data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning. The projects cover a wide range of domains, including retail sales, customer segmentation, sentiment analysis, fraud detection, and more.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data**
   - Performed comprehensive EDA to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from retail sales data.
   - Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and cleaning.
   - Visualized key findings using Matplotlib and Power BI.

### 2. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Applied clustering techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
   - Enhanced customer targeting and marketing strategies through insights generated from the analysis.

### 3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Analyzed customer reviews to understand sentiments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
   - Implemented machine learning models to classify sentiments, providing actionable insights for businesses.

### 4. **Fraud Detection**
   - Built predictive models to identify fraudulent transactions.
   - Leveraged machine learning algorithms to improve fraud detection accuracy and minimize false positives.

### 5. **Wine Quality Prediction**
   - Developed a machine learning model to predict wine quality based on its chemical properties.
   - Used Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms to achieve optimal results.

### 6. **House Price Prediction**
   - Created a regression model to predict house prices using historical housing data.
   - Employed techniques like Linear Regression to analyze and predict housing trends.

## Tools & Technologies
